              <span> What is Bitcoin Assets? </span>
              <p>Bitcoin Assets (BCA) is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 493111 and therewith a new chain will be generated as the BCA. Bitcoin Assets miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Assets”.</p>

              <span>What is the total amount for Bitcoin Assets (BCA)?</span>
              <p>The total amount of BCA is 2100 million. No more increase.1700 million BCA, 1BTC : 100BCA will be presented to the Bitcoin holders for the long-term Bitcoin ECOSYSTEM support.The rest 420 million will be automatically transferred into the community rewards pool as tributes and mining.</p>

              <span>What problems do Bitcoin Assets attempt to solve?</span>
              <p>
                BCA's most straightforward use case is the quick and easy purchase of any digital currency with BCA, which can be exchanged in multi-country currencies at market prices (exchange rates refer to local exchange market prices).<br>
                After nine years of rapid development of Bitcoin, high transactions fees and Bitcoin no longer meets the demands from rising numbers of clients. And various kinds of problems have arisen, which mainly consist of the following aspects:<br>
                1. Lack of privacy protection.<br>
                2. Slow transaction confirmations.<br>
                3. High threshold for new members.

              <span>Is Bitcoin Assets a competitor of Bitcoin?</span>
              <p>
                No, BCA is a complementary relationship with Bitcoin, which speeds up the trading of assets on the market.Bitcoin Assets is fork of the Bitcoin blockchain with upgraded technology while preserving the original features of Bitcoin. A series of new encryption techniques are introduced to encrypt the amount in the transfer, further ensuring the privacy of customers. Besides, it raise the storage size and the block-out speed of each block to an optimum value, to follow segwit and increase the usage of block unit storage trading of the Bitcoin Assets and minimize the production of isolated blocks.

              <span>How does BCA replay attack?</span>
              <p>
                The so-called replay attack refer to the fact that if a transaction is valid in BTC, then the bifurcation of BTC will also take effect, because most of their algorithms are the same. Means that if someone on the BTC launches a deal in the chain and sends the signed deal to another block chain, he will get free BTC that shares the same ratio in that block chain. In order to prevent such replay attack, a slight change has been made on trading format between BTC and BCA, to prevent the replay trading, BCA will not accept BTC deal which truly makes it independent from the BTC.

            <li class="active">
              <span>Why does BCA need to encrypt the transaction amount?</span>
              <p>
                In some application scenarios, especially in many business scenarios, or scenarios that are related to sensitive data such as income of corporate individuals, the BTC holders do not want to disclose their account balances for various reasons. On the one hand, encryption of the transaction amount can protect the privacy of personal funds and avoid the coveting from unscrupulous people. On the other hand, some funds involves trade secrets of certain financial institutions, encryption can protect their money from being exposed, and further ensure the safety of their business activities.

              <p>
                Cryptocurrency exchanges are custodial businesses, which means they control your private keys. When the Bitcoin Assets fork occurs at predetermined height 493111, any exchange that is holding BTC on your behalf will also receive the corresponding BCA. While they should credit your account with the equal amount of BCA, there is no legal authority that can force them to do so. The Bitcoin Assets home page will display the names and logos of exchanges that have promised to credit their users with BCA at 1:10. If your exchange is not shown, please consider transferring your BTC to a supporting exchange or withdraw to a personal wallet where you control the private keys.

              <p>
                BIP44 is a rule which can make HD wallet very powerful, and bitcoin diamond token just follows this rule.
